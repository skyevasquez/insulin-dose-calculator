# Quick Start Guide - Insulin Dose Calculator

Get your Insulin Dose Calculator deployed to Appwrite in minutes!

## Prerequisites Checklist

- ‚úÖ Appwrite CLI installed (already installed on your system)
- [ ] Appwrite account created at [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
- [ ] New Appwrite project created
- [ ] Project ID copied from Appwrite Console

## 5-Minute Deployment

### Step 1: Create Appwrite Project (2 minutes)

1. Go to [https://cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Name it "Insulin Dose Calculator"
4. Copy your **Project ID** from the project settings

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script (2 minutes)

```bash
cd "/Users/skyevasquez/1Projects/Insulin Dose Calculator"
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check your Appwrite CLI installation
- ‚úÖ Verify authentication
- ‚úÖ Configure your Project ID
- ‚úÖ Initialize the project
- ‚úÖ Deploy database collections

### Step 3: Configure Appwrite Console (1 minute)

1. **Enable Authentication:**
   - Go to **Auth** in your Appwrite Console
   - Enable **Email/Password** method

2. **Add Web Platform:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Platforms**
   - Click **Add Platform** > **Web**
   - Enter: `http://localhost:8000` (for local testing)

3. **Set Collection Permissions:**
   - Go to **Databases** > **insulin_db**
   - For each collection:
     - Click on collection
     - Go to **Settings** tab
     - Enable **Document Security**
     - Add **Any** role with Create, Read, Update, Delete permissions

### Step 4: Test Locally

```bash
# Start a local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

1. Create a test account
2. Enter some blood sugar readings
3. Log a dose
4. Verify data persists after logout/login

## Common Issues

### "Project ID not found"
- Double-check you updated both `appwrite-config.js` and `appwrite.json` with your actual Project ID

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify Email/Password auth is enabled in Appwrite Console
- Check that web platform is configured with correct URL

### "Permission denied" errors
- Ensure Document Security is enabled for all collections
- Verify "Any" role has proper permissions

### "CORS errors"
- Add your domain to Platforms in Appwrite Console
- Restart your local server
