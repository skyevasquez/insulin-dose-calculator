## Database Schema

### Firestore Collections

#### `doseHistory`
Stores insulin dose records:
- `userId` (string) - User identifier
- `timestamp` (Timestamp) - When dose was taken
- `bloodSugar` (number) - Blood sugar reading
- `carbs` (number) - Carbohydrates consumed
- `mealType` (string) - Breakfast, lunch, or dinner
- `mealDose` (number) - Insulin units for meal
- `correctionDose` (number) - Insulin units for correction
- `totalDose` (number) - Total insulin units
- `createdAt` (Timestamp) - Document creation time

#### `bsReadings`
Stores blood sugar readings:
- `userId` (string) - User identifier
- `value` (number) - Blood sugar value in mg/dL
- `timestamp` (Timestamp) - When reading was taken
- `createdAt` (Timestamp) - Document creation time

#### `userSettings`
Stores user preferences (document ID = userId):
- `userId` (string) - User identifier
- `name` (string) - User display name
- `lantusTaken` (boolean) - Daily basal insulin status
- `lantusTime` (Timestamp) - When basal was taken
- `lastResetDate` (Timestamp) - Last daily reset
